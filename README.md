This repository contains a sample data processing pipeline to bring 2d data in shapefile format to a 3D model in Blender.

The first step is to downloading the sample file from http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php

Next, run the Jupyter notebook, specififying input and output paths.

Finally, run the Python script from within blender, and it will load the country contours as a set of vertices.
